**Python Feature Toggles Implementation**
---

Allow teams to modify system behavior using coding that can be activated or deactivated (a.k.a Feature Flags).

This is an (evolving) example implementation in Python. Starting form the most simplisctic one (tag v0.0.1), which uses conditional statements only, until the most sophisticated (tag v1.0.0), which implements layers of asbtraction, using Decorators (for Dependency Injection) and Strategy Pattern, for the implementation and choice of the algorithm to be executed.
